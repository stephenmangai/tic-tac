**# This project is about building a tic-tac-toe board for our tic-tac-toe game using HTML and CSS. Hope you have fun!

# So, we know that a Tic Tac Toe game has 9 possible squares that a player can place either an X or an O in. Think about how you might lay this out and give it a shot on your own before you continue.Let's really think about the board in terms of borders. You probably already guessed that we're going to need 9 different elements to represent each move, but you might not think about the best way to lay those out in order to maximize our ability to use CSS efficiently to get the board looking right.**
